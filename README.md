## About
Flow is a one of a kind solution for businesses/organizations to provide fast, partitioned based data storage and retrieval for groups. Flow stores information by the respective group and is only accessible by users with authorization to access those levels. Information is stored categorically and is accessible via natural language or keyword based querying. Access is granted per organization, delegated access by administrators, and managed through Pinecone DB, Mongo Realms/DB, and openAI API.
## Upcoming
I'm currently working to deploy my Cosine-Cassandra software to work as a vector database accessible by a server to replace Pinecone DB for a feature-rich and more accessible DB environment.
